You are tasked by the shop owner to implement the method "calculateTotalPrice(prices, discount)()", which takes the list of prices of the products purchased by a customer and the percentage discount as parameters and returns the total purchase price as an integer (rounded down if the total is a float number).

 

Constraints:

  0 <= discount <= 100

  0 < price of product < 100000

  0 < number of products < 100
